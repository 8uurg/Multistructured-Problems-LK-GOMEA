# Building

## With meson
```
meson build
meson compile -C build
```
Creates the MO_GOMEA executable inside of `./build`

## The old way
Note: This will no longer work due to the addition of a dependency (the assignment implementation).

```
./build.sh
```
Creates the MO_GOMEA executable inside the folder directly.
